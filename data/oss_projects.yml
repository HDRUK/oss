  description: 'The aim of this project is to develop a database of simulated pulse
    waves with which to test pulse wave analysis algorithms.


    A database of simulated pulse waves representative of a sample of healthy adults
    was created. It contains several types of pulse waves (such as those measured
    by smart watches and fitness trackers) at common measurement sites for 4,374 virtual
    subjects aged 25 - 75 years old. The virtual subjects exhibit a range of cardiovascular
    properties across the normal ranges encountered in healthy people. The results
    were verified against in vivo data. Case studies were published (at https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpheart.00218.2019
    ) demonstrating the utility of the database.


    The database is a useful resource for research and education on the topics of:
    signal processing, physiology, and computational modelling.'

    synthetic contact matrices". A preprint version of this paper is available at
    https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028167v1. Some of our notation
    has changed between the preprint and the submission version of the paper. In particular,
    the age-specific susceptibility is now denoted by sigma rather than z.
