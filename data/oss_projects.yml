  description: 'The aim of this project is to develop a database of simulated pulse
    waves with which to test pulse wave analysis algorithms.

    A database of simulated pulse waves representative of a sample of healthy adults
    was created. It contains several types of pulse waves (such as those measured
    by smart watches and fitness trackers) at common measurement sites for 4,374 virtual
    subjects aged 25 - 75 years old. The virtual subjects exhibit a range of cardiovascular
    properties across the normal ranges encountered in healthy people. The results
    were verified against in vivo data. Case studies were published (at https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpheart.00218.2019
    ) demonstrating the utility of the database.

    The database is a useful resource for research and education on the topics of
    - signal processing, physiology, and computational modelling.'

  description: BenevolentAI's Diversity Analysis Tool (DAT) is a software package
    that can be used to produce demographic analysis reports given health data sets
    that contain for fields of age, sex, ethnicity, race and socio-economic status.
    For example, you might have a data about a cohort of patients and want to know
    how well you cover various ethnicities, age groups, sex groups and socio-economic
    status levels. Assuming your data sets have some of these fields, this software
    will help generate various views of the data to help inform your work. The DAT
    tool was developed as part of BenevolentAI's Diversity in Data Initiative, which
    aims to help improve the ways patients are represented in precision medicine.
    It is meant to help inspire other developers to find ways of assessing the data
    diversity in their current and prospective health data sets.

  description: The code in this repository accompanies our upcoming paper "Estimation
    of country-level basic reproductive ratios for novelCoronavirus (COVID-19) using
    synthetic contact matrices". A preprint version of this paper is available at
    https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028167v1. Some of our notation
    has changed between the preprint and the submission version of the paper. In particular,
    the age-specific susceptibility is now denoted by sigma rather than z.

    The 4C Mortality Score is a risk stratification score that predicts in-hospital
    mortality for hospitalised COVID-19 patients, produced by the ISARIC 4C consortium.
    It is intended for use by clinicians. It is designed to be easy-to-use, and require
    only parameters that are commonly available at hospital presentation.

    For full details, see the [paper](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.30.20165464v1)
    introducing the score. This is an infographic that visualises risk, based on observed
