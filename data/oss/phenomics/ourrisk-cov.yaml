description: 'We recently used large-scale samples of NHS patient data to estimate
  the excess risk of mortality which may be associated with coronavirus (COVID-19).
  We wanted to develop this research to inform simple tools to allow interaction and
  exploration by policymakers, researchers and the public. In the OurRisk.CoV tool,
  we provide our initial learning in relation to the implementation and development
  of policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. We have provided some simple tools
  to allow interaction and exploration.

  OurRisk.CoV is initially intended for use by researchers, policy makers and those
  who seek to work with patient data to inform responses to the current emergency.'
