description: 'The ISARIC 4C prognostic score uses data from more than 70,000 hospital
  admissions, we have devised a simple, robust and generalisable prognostic scoring
  system for hospitalised patients.

  The 4C Mortality Score is a risk stratification score that predicts in-hospital
  mortality for hospitalised COVID-19 patients, produced by the ISARIC 4C consortium.
  It is intended for use by clinicians. It is designed to be easy-to-use, and require
  only parameters that are commonly available at hospital presentation.

  For full details, see the [paper](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.30.20165464v1)
  introducing the score. This is an infographic that visualises risk, based on observed
  mortality among hospitalised adult COVID19 patients recruited into the ISARIC 4C
  study in the UK.'
