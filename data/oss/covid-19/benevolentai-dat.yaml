description: BenevolentAI's Diversity Analysis Tool (DAT) is a software package that
  can be used to produce demographic analysis reports given health data sets that
  contain for fields of age, sex, ethnicity, race and socio-economic status. For example,
  you might have a data about a cohort of patients and want to know how well you cover
  various ethnicities, age groups, sex groups and socio-economic status levels. Assuming
  your data sets have some of these fields, this software will help generate various
  views of the data to help inform your work. The DAT tool was developed as part of
  BenevolentAI's Diversity in Data Initiative, which aims to help improve the ways
  patients are represented in precision medicine. It is meant to help inspire other
  developers to find ways of assessing the data diversity in their current and prospective
  health data sets.
