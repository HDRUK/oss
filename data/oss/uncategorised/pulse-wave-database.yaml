description: 'The aim of this project is to develop a database of simulated pulse
  waves with which to test pulse wave analysis algorithms.

  A database of simulated pulse waves representative of a sample of healthy adults
  was created. It contains several types of pulse waves (such as those measured by
  smart watches and fitness trackers) at common measurement sites for 4,374 virtual
  subjects aged 25 - 75 years old. The virtual subjects exhibit a range of cardiovascular
  properties across the normal ranges encountered in healthy people. The results were
  verified against in vivo data. Case studies were published (at https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpheart.00218.2019
  ) demonstrating the utility of the database.

  The database is a useful resource for research and education on the topics of -
  signal processing, physiology, and computational modelling.'
