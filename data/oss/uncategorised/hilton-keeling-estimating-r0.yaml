description: The code in this repository accompanies our upcoming paper "Estimation
  of country-level basic reproductive ratios for novelCoronavirus (COVID-19) using
  synthetic contact matrices". A preprint version of this paper is available at https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028167v1.
  Some of our notation has changed between the preprint and the submission version
  of the paper. In particular, the age-specific susceptibility is now denoted by sigma
  rather than z.
